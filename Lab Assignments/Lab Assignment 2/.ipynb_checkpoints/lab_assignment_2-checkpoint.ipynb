    "**We choose to use Householder's reflection. As suggested by the textbooks [1, 2], a reflection far from the original point should be picked to avoid loss of significance. The resulting function can be found as `lab2.QR` from above codes -- a function to perform QR decomposition, works for both real and complex matrices. As for the post-processing to makes diagonal entries of $R$ nonnegative, we simply noted that: $$A=QR=\\sum^n_{i=1}q_i r_i=\\sum^n_{i=1}\\text{sgn}\\left(r_{ii}\\right)q_i\\frac{r_i}{\\text{sgn}\\left(r_{ii}\\right)}$$ where $q_i$ is the $i$th column of $Q$ and $r_i$ is the $i$th row of $R$, here $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign function with $\\text{sgn}\\left(0\\right)=1$.** \n",

This way, all eigenvalues can supposedly be computed quickly. Plot $\\left|A_{n,n-1}\\right|$ as well as the error of the corresponding eigenvalue (that is, $\\left|\\lambda_n - A_{n,n-1}\\right|$) against the iteration number. Note that the variable n here takes diﬀerent values in diﬀerent stages as the matrix is cropped to become smaller and smaller. Use a log-log scale for the vertical axis. Do this for all 3 versions of the QR algorithm. Experiment with some interesting combinations of eigenvalues. Comment on your results.*\n",
