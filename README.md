# MATH 578 Numerical Analysis 

This repository serves as my study material collection and lab assignments submission platform for [MATH 578 Numerical Analysis](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/math578f20/ "MATH 578 Course Page"). 

------------------------------
**All my written lab assignments are in [this folder](Lab%20Assignments "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignments"), and here is the list of them:**
- [Lab Assignment 1](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%201/lab_assignment_1.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 1")
- [Lab Assignment 2](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%202/lab_assignment_2.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 2")
- [Lab Assignment 3](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%203/lab_assignment_3.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 3")
------------------------------

The slides created for my course seminar presentation can be found [here](Course%20Seminar/578_seminar_talk.pdf "Kai's MATH 578 Seminar Slides") -- it's a short($\approx 30$minutes) talk on SVD.

------------------------------
My organized and summarized notes based on the lecture notes from the class can be found [here](Student%20Notes/MATH578_student_notes.pdf "Kai's MATH 578 Student Notes") -- I prefer not to use markdown due to the tex packages I needed to create this.
