# MATH 598 Numerical Analysis 

This repository serves as my study material collection and lab assignments submission platform for [MATH 598 Numerical Analysis, Fall 2020](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/math578f20/ "MATH 598 Course Page"). 

**All my written lab assignments are in [this folder](Lab%20Assignments "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignments"), and here is the list of them:**
|- [Lab Assignment 1](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%201/lab_assignment_1.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 1")
|- [Lab Assignment 2](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%202/lab_assignment_2.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 2")
|- [Lab Assignment 3](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%203/lab_assignment_3.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 3")

My summarized, parsimonious notes for the class can be found [here](Summarized%20Notes/MATH578_summarized_notes.pdf "Kai's MATH 578 Summarized Notes") -- I prefer not to use markdown due to the tex packages I need to create this.
