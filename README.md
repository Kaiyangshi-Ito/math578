# MATH 578 Numerical Analysis 

This repository serves as my study material collection and lab assignments submission platform for [MATH 578 Numerical Analysis](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/math578f20/ "MATH 578 Course Page"). 

------------------------------

**While theory assignments are uploaded to MyCourses directly, all my written lab assignments are in [this folder](Lab%20Assignments "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignments"), and here is the list of them:**

- [Lab Assignment 1](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%201/lab_assignment_1.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 1") on solving linear systems (primarily stability of Gaussian elimination)
- [Lab Assignment 2](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%202/lab_assignment_2.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 2") on eigenvalue problems (primarily QR algorithms for eigenvalue problems)
- [Lab Assignment 3](Lab%20Assignments/Lab%20Assignment%203/lab_assignment_3.ipynb "Kai's MATH 578 lab assignment 3") on numerical ODE (primarily Rungeâ€“Kutta methods for numerical ODE) 

***A coding note: I used `numpy` for the lab assignments. Note that to run everything on GPU, it's easy to simply replace `numpy` with `cupy`; and to use complier, it's trivial with `numba` -- at least those are my usual preferences of coding packages for computation in Python (remark: it's 2020 as I type down this line). However, computation for the lab assignments is actually not too intense -- *if it's coded in an efficient manner*, which is why I don't bother with `cupy` or `numba` here for the assignments.***

The slides created for my course seminar presentation can be found [here](Course%20Seminar/578_seminar_talk.pdf "Kai's MATH 578 Seminar Slides") -- it's a 30 minutes short talk on SVD.

My re-organized and summarized notes based on the lecture notes from the class can be found [here](Student%20Notes/MATH578_student_notes.pdf "Kai's MATH 578 Student Notes") -- I prefer not to use markdown due to the tex packages I needed to create this.
